# Hi, I'm Jasmine Tran!

I'm a high school sophomore from California! I'm excited to write about life and little things that I'm working on in this blog. I want to pursue computer engineering in college, but I've also been getting interested in electrical engineering after joining robotics. Who knows! I have yet to experience many things.

It all started when I was a little kid. I got my hands on Minecraft and then everything took off from there. I loved playing video games, and I started to learn how to code with Scratch and made games in Roblox Studio, but nothing fancy. Playing games has been a hobby that's always stuck with me. My favorite game right now is _Red Dead Redemption 2_, with _Detroit: Become Human_ being a close second. But with school, I haven't had the chance to play anything recently. Lots of homework.

I always felt like I was an engineer since I was young. I was craftsy, and used to make my own toys. My favorite toy was probably my hot glue gun. On my left ring finger, I have a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt. It's a burn scar from hot glue, and from afar it's not noticeable. When you come closer and feel it is when you realize it's there. I think that's symbolic in a way; that electrical engineering nature is always in me deep down.

But my eyes truly opened when my sister bought me _Sons of the Forest_ for my birthday. I so badly wished to play this game, but after waiting hours for my old PC to finally install it, I realized my computer couldn't run it. I ended up modifying my computer, and it was super fun. It was like playing with legos. It was fascinating seeing how everything clicks and functions upon each other.

I wanted to see how you could build something out of nothing just like that, so I joined robotics. I think it was a great choice. I've met so many new people and learned so many things. The only thing I regret is not joining earlier.

Moving past that, I love getting creative. I do digital art and like editing videos, and recently have been getting into 3D modeling with Blender as I work on assets for a game I've been working on. I'm hoping to learn animating with Blender too! And I'll be posting the progress that I make on this blog.
