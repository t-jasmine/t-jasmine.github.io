These past months, my friends and I have been working on designing a dog prosthesis for an amputee dog. Slay was involved in a hit-and-run accident, where she unfortunately lost her front left leg. She struggles to walk long distances, but hopefully this prosthesis will help her with that!

As high school students, we've been occupied with lots of homework, exams, and other life activities, so we've unfortunately been progressing very slowly with our work. Here's what we have so far though!

We're starting to 3D print the chest support for the prosthesis, we still need to finalize some of the CAD before we get to that.

As for the leg itself, we are using a simple aluminum rod. To attach it onto the 3D printed chest support, we needed to have a rod mount. At first, we were going to weld different parts together to create it, but we ended up getting CNC machining services to do it!

[PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) reached out to us after seeing our initial blog post and suggested usage of their 3D printing or CNC machining services for our prosthesis project. Their team of engineers is super supportive and easy to work with. At first, we wanted to get our chest support printed by them, but there were many risks regarding transportation and the fabrication process because of the nature of our print. Nonetheless, we were still able to work with PCBWay and get CNC machining for our rod mount instead!

The process was very simple. I uploaded a STEP file into their instant CNC machining quote service. At first, my file had a few errors, but it was quickly resolved. Their team has extremely quick service. When I emailed/messaged PCBWay, they responded within minutes.

I made the mount CAD in OnShape, and this is what I received!

We're now going to begin printing the chest support and putting everything together once my team gets the time to!
